*** Front

    When trying to compute the probability of an event, what should one consider?

*** Back

    Consider whether it is easier to compute the probability of the event of the probability of the event.

*** Front

    What are some problems with the naive definition of probability

*** Back

    1. It assumes that the sample space is finite.
    2. It assumes that all samples have equal probability.

*** Front

    When is the naive definition of probability applicable?

*** Back

    1. *Symmetry*: when the outcomes are equally likely, e.g. coin flips.
    2. *Design*: when the experiment is designed to achieve equal sample probabilities e.g. polling.
    3. *Null model*: when one wants to see what the naive definition yields.
